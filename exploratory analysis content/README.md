Why are you interested in this field/domain?

We are interested in this field because entertainment is so pertinent to ourselves, and plays a great role in current circumstances. As the world becomes more technology advanced, these changes are reflected by entertainment. For example, entertainment platforms have vary drastically throughout the 21st century. New online platforms, such as Netflix and Hulu, have replaced movie theaters and television. Rather than radios, people generally listen to spotify more. The pandemic further takes the evolution of entertainment to another level, forcing more people to adjust to the online entertainment world.
